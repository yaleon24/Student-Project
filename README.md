# Student-Project
Finish the Student class that can keep track of the name of the student as well as the scores for three tests (which may have a decimal value).    Provide a constructor that sets all instance values based on parameter values.  Overload the constructor such that each test score is set to zero and only the Student name is accepted.  Provide a method called setTestScore that accepts two parameters: the test number (1 through 3) and the score.  Also provide a method called getTestScore that accepts the test number and returns the appropriate score.  Provide a method average that computes and returns the average test score for this student.    You will not need to change anything within the main method!
